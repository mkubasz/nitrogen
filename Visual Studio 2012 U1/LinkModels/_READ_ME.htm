<h1>Link UML Elements to Diagrams in Visual Studio Ultimate</h1>
<p><a href="http://code.msdn.microsoft.com/Link-UML-elements-to-0adbf5a8">Distributed on MSDN Code Samples Gallery</a></p>
<p>
  UML elements such as use cases or classes can be linked to another element, UML 
  diagram, or any other file by using this extension of Visual Studio Ultimate. 
  Users create links by dragging, and can later open the link target by 
  double-clicking.</p>
<p>
  When the user double-clicks a linked element, if the link target is:</p>
<ul>
  <li>A UML diagram in the same Visual Studio solution: the diagram will open and 
    come to the front in Visual Studio. </li>
  <li>A specific UML element: it will be selected. </li>
  <li>A word or phrase in a Word doc: the document will open with the phrase 
    selected.</li>
  <li>A slide in PowerPoint.</li>
  <li>Any other type of file: it will open in the appropriate application. </li>
</ul>
<p>
  Links are stored as relative file paths, so that they will work for other team 
  members if the target files are part of the same Visual Studio solution.</p>
<p>
  A small icon is displayed on items that have a link.</p>
<p>
  You can easily adapt the sample code to your own needs. For example, you could 
  add rules that make the name or other attributes of the linked element reflect 
  features of the linked element. The UML tools in Visual Studio Ultimate are 
  implemented on Visualization and Modeling SDK.</p>

  How to run the sample</h1>
<ol>
  <li>You need:
    <ul>
      <li>Visual Studio 2010 Ultimate (or SP1) </li>
      <li>
        <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/en/details.aspx?FamilyID=47305cf4-2bea-43c0-91cd-1b853602dcc5&amp;displaylang=en" 
          target="_blank">Visual Studio SDK</a> </li>
      <li>
        <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/en/details.aspx?FamilyID=0def949d-2933-49c3-ac50-e884e0ff08a7&amp;displaylang=en" 
          target="_blank">Visualization and Modeling SDK</a> ( = DSL Tools) </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Download, unzip, open UmlElementLink.sln </li>
  <li>Press F5 to build and run the sample.
    <ul>
      <li>The sample includes a test model, which will open in an experimental instance 
        of Visual Studio. </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>In any diagram in the test model, drag any of the following items onto any 
    shape on the diagram:
    <ul>
      <li>Any file from Solution Explorer, in the same project or another project.
      </li>
      <li>Any file from Windows Explorer.
        <ul>
          <li>Note that the link will stop working if you later move the solution and the 
            target file into different relative locations. If you use source control, this 
            means that it is advisable to link to files that are in source control; and even 
            better to link to files in the same Visual Studio solution. </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Any element from another UML diagram, in the same UML model (project) or 
        another one. To do this, either display the diagrams side by side; or drag the 
        element up to the tabs, across to the tab of the diagram where you want to drop, 
        and then down to the shape you want to drop onto. </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ol>
<h1>
  How to install the sample on other computers for demonstration purposes</h1>
<p>
  To install the extension on other computers:</p>
<ol>
  <li>The target computer must have Visual Studio Ultimate. It does not need VSSDK 
    or VMSDK. </li>
  <li>Copy the VSIX file from bin\Debug to the target computer. </li>
  <li>Double-click the VSIX. </li>
</ol>
<p>
  To uninstall it, use Tools&gt;Extension Manager in Visual Studio.</p>
<p>
  You can work with models that contain links on computers where the extension is 
  not installed. The links should not be lost.</p>
